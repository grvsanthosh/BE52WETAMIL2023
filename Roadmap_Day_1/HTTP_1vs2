HTTP 1.1 -
    1. In HTTP 1.1 the loads are transferred one after the other. If any one data is not loaded, the other data is blocked. 
    2. Data is transferred in single queue.
    3. In HTTP 1, the server is not allowed to push content to the client before client ask for it.
    4. HTTP 1.1 does not have HPACK compression mechanism to eliminate redundant information in http header packets.

HTTP 2 -
    1. HTTP 2 uses single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once. If any one data is not loaded, it will not affect other data.
    2. Data is splitted using binary code and numbering these data will help client to know which stream each data belongs to.
    3. In HTTP 2, the server is allowed to push contents to the client before client ask for it.
    4. HTTP 2 uses more advanced compression method called HPACK compression that eliminated redundant information in http header packets, which results in faster loading.

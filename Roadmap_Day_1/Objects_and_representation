Objects : 

    In JavaScript Objects are values which are written as key : value pairs. Almost everything in JavaScript are objects except for primitive types. The primitive types are hard loaded data.


representation:

    let person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

    here firstName is key and John is the value.

    Objects can also be return in the below format.

    const person = new Object();
    person.firstName = "John";
    person.lastName = "Doe";
    person.age = 50;
    person.eyeColor = "blue";
